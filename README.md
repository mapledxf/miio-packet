# miio-packet
Base Mi Smart Home Device packet protocol
This library is intented to be used to interface with Mi Smart Home devices using Xiaomi's [miIO protocol](https://github.com/OpenMiHome/mihome-binary-protocol), such as Mi Robot Vacuum, Mi Air Purifier, Philips LED Ball Lamp, etc.

# Getting started
Please see [test.py](https://github.com/mapledxf/miio-packet/blob/master/test.py) for example.

# Thanks
Please take a look at [python-miio](https://github.com/rytilahti/python-miio) if you are looking for more supported devices and commands.

# Note
I am using this libiary in my Domoticz. For some reson, all the AES scripts are not working in Domoticz. That is why I used a work around for AES encryption and decryption.
