# miio-packet
Base Mi Smart Home Device packet protocol
This library is intented to be used to interface with Mi Smart Home devices using Xiaomi's miIO protocol, such as Mi Robot Vacuum, Mi Air Purifier, Philips LED Ball Lamp, etc.

# Getting started
Please see test.py for example.

# Note
I am using this libiary in my Domoticz. For some reson, all the AES scripts are not working in Domoticz. That is why I used a work around for AES encryption and decryption.
